# 🧠 Kidney Classification using Teachable Machine

This project applies image classification to detect four kidney conditions using Google's Teachable Machine.  
It was implemented as part of a data analysis and AI training program.

---

## 🧪 Classes

The model classifies kidney ultrasound images into the following categories:

- **Normal** (كلى طبيعية)  
- **Kidney Cyst** (تكيس كلوي)  
- **Kidney Stone** (حصوة كلى)  
- **Kidney Tumor** (ورم كلوي)

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is a curated subset of a larger dataset available on Kaggle, which includes thousands of ultrasound images.

- **Training**: 65 images per class  
- **Testing**: A few unseen images per class (manually selected)

The dataset was organized into `train/` and `test/` folders and used directly in Teachable Machine's image project interface.
